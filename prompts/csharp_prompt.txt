## Project Overview
Enhance the **dotNET-mail-demo** project by improving email sending functionality and adding robust unit tests.

## Requirements
- Implement an **EmailService** class that:
  - Sends transactional emails via API.
  - Supports batch email sending using predefined segments.
  - Uses FluentEmail or another email library for templating.
- Ensure **error handling** for failed email deliveries.
- Write **unit tests** using xUnit to validate email sending logic.
- Implement **logging** for email transactions using Serilog.
- Follow **clean architecture principles** and **dependency injection**.

## Test Cases (Using xUnit)
- Verify that `SendEmail("test@example.com", "Subject", "Body")` successfully sends an email.
- Ensure that sending an email to an invalid address throws an appropriate exception.
- Validate batch email sending functionality.
- Test logging behavior to confirm email transactions are recorded.

## Additional Guidelines
- Use **async/await** for non-blocking email operations.
- Follow **SOLID principles** for maintainability.
- Generate XML documentation (`/// <summary>...</summary>`) for all public methods.
